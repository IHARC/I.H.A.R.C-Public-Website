# Codex Build Log â€” IHARC Solutions Portal

## Session 1
- Converted repo from Astro placeholder to Next.js 14 App Router scaffold with Tailwind + shadcn-ready tooling.
- Updated build pipeline to run `next lint` + `next build` for Azure deployment.
- Set up base layout, global styles, theme provider, and redirect root to `/command-center`.
- Provisioned new `portal` schema with idea, comment, vote, flag, metrics, and audit tables; wired helpers, triggers, RLS, and private storage bucket `portal-attachments` via Supabase migration.
- Added edge functions `portal-ingest-metrics` (secret-gated upsert) and `portal-moderate` (role-aware moderation actions with audit logging).
- Implemented core portal UI: Command Center dashboard + admin upload flow, idea list/detail/submit pages, comment experience, moderation queue, and profile editor scaffolding.

Next focus: wire API/route handlers (ideas, votes, comments, flags, metrics), integrate rate limiting + safety checks end-to-end, connect attachment upload/view flows, and document setup/testing steps.
