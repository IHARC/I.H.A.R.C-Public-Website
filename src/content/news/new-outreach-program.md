We're excited to announce the launch of our new Mobile Outreach Program, designed to provide direct support and resources to individuals experiencing homelessness throughout Northumberland County.

## Program Overview

The Mobile Outreach Program features a specially equipped vehicle that serves as a mobile command center for our outreach team. This initiative allows us to bring services directly to those who need them most, regardless of their location.

### Key Services Include:

- **Immediate Crisis Support**: On-site assessment and intervention for individuals in crisis situations
- **Resource Connection**: Direct linkage to housing, healthcare, and social services
- **Harm Reduction Supplies**: Distribution of safety equipment and health supplies
- **Case Management**: Follow-up support and service coordination

## Impact Goals

Through this program, we aim to:
- Reduce response times for crisis interventions
- Increase service accessibility in rural areas
- Provide more consistent follow-up support
- Strengthen connections between community members and available resources

The Mobile Outreach Program operates seven days a week, with extended hours during extreme weather conditions. Community members can request outreach services by calling our main line or through our online referral system.

*This program is made possible through funding from the Provincial Community Safety Initiative and partnerships with local healthcare providers.*
